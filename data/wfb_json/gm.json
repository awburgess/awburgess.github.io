{"Introduction": {"Background": "The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965. Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya JAMMEH led a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in 1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2011.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and Senegal", "Geographic coordinates": "13 28 N, 16 34 W", "Map references": "Africa", "Area - comparative": "slightly less than twice the size of Delaware", "Area": {"total": "11,295 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "167", "land": "10,000 sq km", "water": "1,295 sq km"}, "Coastline": "80 km", "Land boundaries": {"total": "749 km", "border countries": "Senegal 749 km"}, "Climate": "tropical;

About three-quarters of the population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood and the sector provides for about one-fifth of GDP. The agricultural sector has untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In 2012, however, sluggish tourism led to a decline in GDP. Tourism brings in about one-fifth of GDP. Agriculture also took a hit in 2012 due to unfavorable weather patterns. The Gambia's re-export trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports. Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high. Economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. International donors and lenders continue to be concerned about the quality of fiscal management and The Gambia's debt burden.", "GDP (purchasing power parity)": "$3.678 billion (2013 est.)", "GDP (official exchange rate)": "$896 million (2013 est.)", "GDP - real growth rate": "6.4% (2013 est.)", "GDP - per capita (PPP)": "$2,000 (2013 est.)", "Gross national saving": "16.3% of GDP (2013 est.)", "GDP - composition, by end use": {"country comparison to the world": "102", "note": "data are in 2013 US dollars", "household consumption": "89.2%", "government consumption": "10.9%", "investment in fixed capital": "19.1%", "investment in inventories": "0%", "exports of goods and services": "28%", "imports of goods and services": "-47.3%"}, "Agriculture - products": "rice, millet, sorghum, peanuts, corn, sesame, cassava (manioc, tapioca), palm kernels;
