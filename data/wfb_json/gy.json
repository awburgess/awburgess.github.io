{"Introduction": {"Background": "Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to settlement of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The resulting ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001 and again in 2006. Donald RAMOTAR was elected president in 2011.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Suriname and Venezuela", "Geographic coordinates": "5 00 N, 59 00 W", "Map references": "South America", "Area - comparative": "slightly smaller than Idaho", "Area": {"total": "214,969 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "85", "land": "196,849 sq km", "water": "18,120 sq km"}, "Coastline": "459 km", "Land boundaries": {"total": "2,933 km", "border countries": "Brazil 1,308 km, Suriname 836 km, Venezuela 789 km"}, "Climate": "tropical; hot, humid, moderated by northeast trade winds; two rainy seasons (May to August, November to January)", "Terrain": "mostly rolling highlands; low coastal plain; savanna in south", "Maritime claims": {"territorial sea": "12 nm", "exclusive economic zone": "200 nm", "continental shelf": "200 nm or to the outer edge of the continental margin"}, "Natural resources": "bauxite, gold, diamonds, hardwood timber, shrimp, fish", "Elevation extremes": {"lowest point": "Atlantic Ocean 0 m", "highest point": "Mount Roraima 2,835 m"}, "Irrigated land": "1,501 sq km (2003)", "Total renewable water resources": "241 cu km (2011)", "Land use": {"arable land": "1.95%", "permanent crops": "0.13%", "other": "97.92% (2011)"}, "Natural hazards": "flash flood threat during rainy seasons", "Environment - current issues": "water pollution from sewage and agricultural and industrial chemicals; deforestation", "Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)": {"total": "1.64  cu km/yr (4%/1%/94%)", "per capita": "2,222  cu m/yr (2010)"}, "Geography - note": "the third-smallest country in South America after Suriname and Uruguay; substantial portions of its western and eastern territories are claimed by Venezuela and Suriname respectively", "Environment - international agreements": {"party to": "Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94", "signed, but not ratified": "none of the selected agreements"}}, "People": {"Ethnic groups": "East Indian 43.5%, black (African) 30.2%, mixed 16.7%, Amerindian 9.1%, other 0.5% (2002 census)", "Languages": "English, Amerindian dialects, Creole, Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Urdu", "Religions": "Protestant 30.5% (Pentecostal 16.9%, Anglican 6.9%, Seventh Day Adventist 5%, Methodist 1.7%), Hindu 28.4%, Roman Catholic 8.1%, Muslim 7.2%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.1%, other Christian 17.7%, other 1.9%, none 4.3%, unspecified 0.9% (2002 est.)", "Demographic profile": "Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America and shares cultural and historical bonds with the Anglophone Caribbean.

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years have seen the government's stock of debt reduced significantly - with external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. Despite recent improvements, the government is still juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 60% in 2013. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of Guyana's growth in recent years has come from a surge in gold production in response to global prices, although downward trends in gold prices may threaten future growth. In 2013, production of sugar dropped to a 23-year low.", "GDP (purchasing power parity)": "$6.593 billion (2013 est.)", "GDP (official exchange rate)": "$3.02 billion (2013 est.)", "GDP - real growth rate": "5.3% (2013 est.)", "GDP - per capita (PPP)": "$8,500 (2013 est.)", "Gross national saving": "6.2% of GDP (2013 est.)", "GDP - composition, by end use": {"country comparison to the world": "145", "note": "data are in 2013 US dollars", "household consumption": "85.6%", "government consumption": "16.3%", "investment in fixed capital": "22.5%", "investment in inventories": "-13.5%", "exports of goods and services": "59.9%", "imports of goods and services": "-70.8%"}, "Agriculture - products": "sugarcane, rice, edible oils;
