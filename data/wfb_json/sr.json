{"Introduction": {"Background": "First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of African slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to power.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between French Guiana and Guyana", "Geographic coordinates": "4 00 N, 56 00 W", "Map references": "South America", "Area - comparative": "slightly larger than Georgia", "Area": {"total": "163,820 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "92", "land": "156,000 sq km", "water": "7,820 sq km"}, "Coastline": "386 km", "Land boundaries": {"total": "1,703 km", "border countries": "Brazil 593 km, French Guiana 510 km, Guyana 600 km"}, "Climate": "tropical; moderated by trade winds", "Terrain": "mostly rolling hills; narrow coastal plain with swamps", "Maritime claims": {"territorial sea": "12 nm", "exclusive economic zone": "200 nm"}, "Natural resources": "timber, hydropower, fish, kaolin, shrimp, bauxite, gold, and small amounts of nickel, copper, platinum, iron ore", "Elevation extremes": {"lowest point": "unnamed location in the coastal plain -2 m", "highest point": "Juliana Top 1,230 m"}, "Irrigated land": "511.8 sq km (2003)", "Total renewable water resources": "122 cu km (2011)", "Land use": {"arable land": "0.36%", "permanent crops": "0.04%", "other": "99.6% (2011)"}, "Natural hazards": "NA", "Environment - current issues": "deforestation as timber is cut for export; pollution of inland waterways by small-scale mining activities", "Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)": {"total": "0.67  cu km/yr (6%/4%/90%)", "per capita": "1,396  cu m/yr (2006)"}, "Geography - note": "smallest independent country on South American continent; mostly tropical rain forest; great diversity of flora and fauna that, for the most part, is increasingly threatened by new development; relatively small population, mostly along the coast", "Environment - international agreements": {"party to": "Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling", "signed, but not ratified": "none of the selected agreements"}}, "People": {"Ethnic groups": "Hindustani (also known locally as \"East Indians\"; their ancestors emigrated from northern India in the latter part of the 19th century) 37%, Creole (mixed white and black) 31%, Javanese 15%, \"Maroons\" (their African ancestors were brought to the country in the 17th and 18th centuries as slaves and escaped to the interior) 10%, Amerindian 2%, Chinese 2%, white 1%, other 2%", "Languages": "Dutch (official), English (widely spoken), Sranang Tongo (Surinamese, sometimes called Taki-Taki, is native language of Creoles and much of the younger population and is lingua franca among others), Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Javanese", "Religions": "Hindu 27.4%, Protestant 25.2% (predominantly Moravian), Roman Catholic 22.8%, Muslim 19.6%, indigenous beliefs 5%", "Demographic profile": "Suriname is a pluralistic society consisting primarily of Creoles (persons of mixed African and European heritage), the descendants of escaped African slaves known as Maroons, and the descendants of Indian and Javanese contract workers.

In January 2011, the government devalued the currency by 20% and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit. As a result of these measures, inflation has receded to about 4% in 2013. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.
