{"Introduction": {"Background": "There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. Apart from North Keeling Island, which lies 30 kilometers north of the main group, the islands form a horseshoe-shaped atoll surrounding a lagoon. North Keeling Island was declared a national park in 1995 and is administered by Parks Australia. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Southeastern Asia, group of islands in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Indonesia, about halfway between Australia and Sri Lanka", "Geographic coordinates": "12 30 S, 96 50 E", "Map references": "Oceania", "Area - comparative": "about 24 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC", "Land boundaries": "0 km", "Coastline": "26 km", "Area": {"total": "14 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "241", "land": "14 sq km", "water": "0 sq km", "note": "includes the two main islands of West Island and Home Island"}, "Climate": "tropical with high humidity, moderated by the southeast trade winds for about nine months of the year", "Terrain": "flat, low-lying coral atolls", "Maritime claims": {"territorial sea": "12 nm", "exclusive fishing zone": "200 nm"}, "Natural resources": "fish", "Elevation extremes": {"lowest point": "Indian Ocean 0 m", "highest point": "unnamed location 5 m"}, "Irrigated land": "NA", "Natural hazards": "cyclone season is October to April", "Environment - current issues": "freshwater resources are limited to rainwater accumulations in natural underground reservoirs", "Geography - note": "islands are thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation; site of a World War I naval battle in November 1914 between the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney and the German raider SMS Emden; after being heavily damaged in the engagement, the Emden was beached by her captain on North Keeling Island", "Land use": {"arable land": "0%", "permanent crops": "0%", "other": "100% (2011)"}}, "People": {"Ethnic groups": "Europeans, Cocos Malays", "Languages": "Malay (Cocos dialect), English", "Religions": "Sunni Muslim 80%, other 20% (2002 est.)", "Population": "596 (July 2014 est.)", "Population growth rate": "0% (2014 est.)", "Nationality": {"noun": "Cocos Islander(s)", "adjective": "Cocos Islander", "country comparison to the world": "196"}, "Infant mortality rate": {"total": "NA", "male": "NA", "female": "NA"}, "Total fertility rate": "NA (2014 est.)", "HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate": "NA", "HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS": "NA", "HIV/AIDS - deaths": "NA", "Literacy": "NA", "Life expectancy at birth": {"total population": "NA", "male": "NA", "female": "NA"}}, "Government": {"Dependency status": "non-self governing territory of Australia; administered from Canberra by the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport", "Government type": "NA", "Country name": {"conventional long form": "Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands", "conventional short form": "Cocos (Keeling) Islands"}, "Administrative divisions": "none (territory of Australia)", "Independence": "none (territory of Australia)", "National holiday": "Australia Day, 26 January (1788)", "Constitution": "23 November 1955 (Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955); amended many times, last in 2010 (2010)", "Legal system": "common law based on the Australian model", "Suffrage": "18 years of age", "Capital": {"name": "West Island", "geographic coordinates": "12 10 S, 96 50 E", "time difference": "UTC+6.5 (11.5 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)"}, "Legislative branch": "unicameral Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council (7 seats)", "Executive branch": {"chief of state": "Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952) represented by the Australian governor general", "head of government": "Administrator (nonresident) Jon STANHOPE (since 5 October 2012)", "cabinet": "NA", "elections": "held every two years with half the members standing for election; last held in October 2011 (next to be held in October 2013)"}, "Political parties and leaders": "none", "Political pressure groups and leaders": "The Cocos Islands Youth Support Centre", "International organization participation": "none", "Diplomatic representation in the US": "none (territory of Australia)", "Diplomatic representation from the US": "none (territory of Australia)", "Flag description": "the flag of Australia is used", "Judicial branch": {"highest court(s)": "under the terms of the Territorial Law Reform Act 1992, Western Australia provides court services as needed for the island including the Supreme Court and subordinate courts (District Court, Magistrate Court, Family Court, Children's Court, and Coroners' Court)", "judge selection and term of office": "NA", "subordinate courts": "NA"}, "National anthem": {"note": "as a territory of Australia, \"Advance Australia Fair\" remains official as the national anthem, while \"God Save the Queen\" serves as the royal anthem (see Australia)"}}, "Economy": {"Economy - overview": "Coconuts, grown throughout the islands, are the sole cash crop.
