{"Introduction": {"Background": "In 1783, the Sunni Al-Khalifa family took power in Bahrain. In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has become an international banking center. Bahrain's small size and central location among Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. The Sunni-led government has struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar protests at home with police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation Council security forces to Bahrain. Sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces continue in Bahrain. Ongoing dissatisfaction with the political status quo has led to a broader discussion termed the Bahrain National Dialogue, a process that convenes members of the executive, parliament, and political societies in an attempt to reach a political agreement.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Middle East, archipelago in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia", "Geographic coordinates": "26 00 N, 50 33 E", "Map references": "Middle East", "Area - comparative": "3.5 times the size of Washington, DC", "Land boundaries": "0 km", "Coastline": "161 km", "Area": {"total": "760 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "188", "land": "760 sq km", "water": "0 sq km"}, "Climate": "arid;

Bahrain's economy, however, continues to depend heavily on oil. In 2012, petroleum production and refining accounted for 77% of Bahrain's export receipts, 87% of government revenues, and 19% of GDP. Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. In 2011 Bahrain experienced economic setbacks as a result of domestic unrest, however, the economy recovered in 2012-13, partly as a result of improved tourism. Some economic policies aimed at restoring confidence in Bahrain's economy, such as the suspension of an expatriate labor tax and frequent bailouts of Gulf Air, will make Bahrain's long-term economic challenges - youth unemployment and the growth of government debt - more difficult to address.", "GDP (purchasing power parity)": "$34.96 billion (2013 est.)", "GDP (official exchange rate)": "$28.36 billion (2013 est.)", "GDP - real growth rate": "4.4% (2013 est.)", "GDP - per capita (PPP)": "$29,800 (2013 est.)", "Gross national saving": "27.6% of GDP (2013 est.)", "GDP - composition, by end use": {"country comparison to the world": "36", "note": "data are in 2013 US dollars", "household consumption": "39.8%", "government consumption": "15.6%", "investment in fixed capital": "20.7%", "investment in inventories": "0.8%", "exports of goods and services": "74.8%", "imports of goods and services": "-51.7%"}, "Agriculture - products": "fruit, vegetables;
