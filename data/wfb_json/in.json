{"Introduction": {"Background": "The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence, which was granted in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring nations have fought three wars since independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as a regional and global power.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and Pakistan", "Geographic coordinates": "20 00 N, 77 00 E", "Map references": "Asia", "Area": {"total": "3,287,263 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "7", "land": "2,973,193 sq km", "water": "314,070 sq km"}, "Coastline": "7,000 km", "Area - comparative": {"Area comparison map": "Land boundaries:total:13,888 km", "border countries": "Bangladesh 4,142 km, Bhutan 659 km, Burma 1,468 km, China 2,659 km, Nepal 1,770 km, Pakistan 3,190 km"}, "Climate": "varies from tropical monsoon in south to temperate in north", "Terrain": "upland plain (Deccan Plateau) in south, flat to rolling plain along the Ganges, deserts in west, Himalayas in north", "Maritime claims": {"territorial sea": "12 nm", "contiguous zone": "24 nm", "exclusive economic zone": "200 nm", "continental shelf": "200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"}, "Natural resources": "coal (fourth-largest reserves in the world), iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, rare earth elements, titanium ore, chromite, natural gas, diamonds, petroleum, limestone, arable land", "Elevation extremes": {"lowest point": "Indian Ocean 0 m", "highest point": "Kanchenjunga 8,598 m"}, "Irrigated land": "663,340 sq km (2008)", "Total renewable water resources": "1,911 cu km (2011)", "Land use": {"arable land": "47.87%", "permanent crops": "3.74%", "other": "48.39% (2011)"}, "Natural hazards": "droughts;

Economic liberalization measures, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and served to accelerate the country's growth, which averaged under 7% per year from 1997 to 2011. India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services. Slightly less than half of the work force is in agriculture, but, services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of India's output with less than one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services, business outsourcing services, and software workers. India's economic growth began slowing in 2011 because of a decline in investment, caused by high interest rates, rising inflation, and investor pessimism about the government's commitment to further economic reforms and about the global situation. In late 2012, the Indian Government announced additional reforms and deficit reduction measures, including allowing higher levels of foreign participation in direct investment in the economy. The outlook for India's long-term growth is moderately positive due to a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy. However, India has many challenges that it has yet to fully address, including poverty, corruption, violence and discrimination against women and girls, an inefficient power generation and distribution system, ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights, decades-long civil litigation dockets, inadequate transport and agricultural infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, high spending and poorly-targeted subsidies, inadequate availability of quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban migration. Growth in 2013 fell to a decade low, as India's economic leaders struggled to improve the country's wide fiscal and current account deficits. Rising macroeconomic imbalances in India and improving economic conditions in Western countries, led investors to shift capital away from India, prompting a sharp depreciation of the rupee. However, investors' perceptions of India improved in early 2014, due to a reduction of the current account deficit and expectations of post-election economic reform, resulting in a surge of inbound capital flows and stabilization of the rupee.", "GDP (purchasing power parity)": "$4.99 trillion (2013 est.)", "GDP (official exchange rate)": "$1.67 trillion (2013 est.)", "GDP - real growth rate": "3.2% (2013 est.)", "GDP - per capita (PPP)": "$4,000 (2013 est.)", "Gross national saving": "33.7% of GDP (2013 est.)", "GDP - composition, by end use": {"country comparison to the world": "16", "note": "data are in 2013 US dollars", "household consumption": "56.4%", "government consumption": "12.4%", "investment in fixed capital": "29.6%", "investment in inventories": "8.2%", "exports of goods and services": "25.2%", "imports of goods and services": "-31.8%"}, "Agriculture - products": "rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, lentils, onions, potatoes;
