{"Introduction": {"Background": "Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century, the island became a French possession in 1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864.

The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.", "null": {}}, "Geography": {"Location": "Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Australia", "Geographic coordinates": "21 30 S, 165 30 E", "Map references": "Oceania", "Area - comparative": "slightly smaller than New Jersey", "Land boundaries": "0 km", "Coastline": "2,254 km", "Area": {"total": "18,575 sq km", "country comparison to the world": "156", "land": "18,275 sq km", "water": "300 sq km"}, "Climate": "tropical;
